#### DSP homebrewed Signal Processing Library
- built basic blocks in numpy like Add, Filter, Rect.
- realized with the blocks signal processing functions like sampling, DFT, STFT, ISTFT in an efficient decimation based implementation - every action complete with block diagram, and examples. 
- used them to build a binary classifier between two signal types - natural, and digital, that can discern well between the two even when noised with a white gaussian noise of varying amplitudes.
